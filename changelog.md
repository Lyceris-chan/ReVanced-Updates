- Build YouTube Music ReVanced non-root (requires Vanced MicroG)

**Notes**
1. You will have to disable "Enable auto update" for YouTube in the Play Store

2. The Magisk module for root users doesn't require MicroG

3. As always these builds are unofficial this also counts for the updater.

4. Check the build log if you want to know which patches were included / excluded.

5. Both Reddit and Twitter are a low priority for me, this means that I won't be updating them seperatly and that updates aren't guaranteed for these apps.
